# Feature Specification: Yarson Portfolio Homepage

**Feature Branch**: `[001-portfolio-homepage]`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "i want to build a portfolio website for myself named \"Yarson\" (my nickname and name of business), i'm a fullstack developer focusing on AI driven automations and integrations, chatbots, AI RAG agents, developing tools, widgets and systems for businesses. i want to start small, for now i want to create only a basic homepage with a basic header with floating nav bar: Home | Work | About | Contact

for now - no need to create the other pages, only create the homepage.
the main section of the homepage (below the header) would contain a short simple sentence just as a placeholder for now. then the footer, with basic nav links, and copyright text with year, name \"Yarson\".
The header and footer are shared layout components rendered once for the entire app."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - View homepage with persistent navigation (Priority: P1)

As a visitor, I can open the Yarson site and immediately see a floating header with nav links, a simple placeholder sentence in the main section, and a footer with links and copyright, so I understand the brand and structure at a glance.

**Why this priority**: Establishes the initial MVP presence and validates layout and branding.

**Independent Test**: Load the root URL and verify the presence and content of header, main tagline, and footer without interacting with any other pages.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a fresh session on desktop, **When** I visit the site root, **Then** I see a floating header with links: Home, Work, About, Contact.
2. **Given** any scroll position, **When** I scroll the page, **Then** the header remains fixed at the top (floating).
3. **Given** the page has loaded, **When** I view the main section, **Then** I see the placeholder sentence: "AI-driven automations and integrations by Yarson."
4. **Given** the page has loaded, **When** I view the footer, **Then** I see nav links (Home, Work, About, Contact) and the copyright text "© <current year> Yarson".

### User Story 2 - Navigation links present as placeholders (Priority: P2)

As a visitor, I can see navigation items in the header and footer, and clicking them does not navigate away (except Home which returns to top), so the site remains a single-page MVP without broken routes.

**Why this priority**: Prevents 404s or unintended navigation while signaling site structure.

**Independent Test**: Click each nav item and verify page location remains on the homepage; Home brings the viewport to the top.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the homepage is visible, **When** I click Work/About/Contact, **Then** the URL and page do not change to a different route.
2. **Given** the homepage is visible, **When** I click Home, **Then** the viewport scrolls to the top of the page.

### User Story 3 - Basic accessibility and responsiveness (Priority: P3)

As a keyboard and mobile user, I can read and navigate the header and footer links in a logical order and view them clearly on small screens, so the site is usable across devices.

**Why this priority**: Ensures inclusive access and mobile readiness of the MVP.

**Independent Test**: Use Tab/Shift+Tab to move focus through nav items; simulate widths from 320px to 1440px and verify readable, non-overlapping layout.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I use a keyboard, **When** I tab through the page, **Then** focus moves in order through header links, then footer links.
2. **Given** a 320px-wide viewport, **When** I view the header, **Then** nav items remain visible/readable without overlap or clipping.

---

### Edge Cases

- Very small screens (≤320px): header links still readable and accessible.
- Long content or future sections: header remains fixed without jitter or overlap.
- Year changeover (Dec→Jan): copyright year reflects the current year without manual updates.
- JavaScript disabled: header, main tagline, and footer content still render.
- High-contrast/OS accessibility modes: text remains readable with sufficient contrast.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Provide a shared header rendered once across the app with a floating/fixed position at the top during scroll.
- **FR-002**: Header contains a nav bar with exactly four items, in order: "Home", "Work", "About", "Contact".
- **FR-003**: The main section below the header displays the exact placeholder sentence: "AI-driven automations and integrations by Yarson." (copy may be updated in future features).
- **FR-004**: Provide a shared footer rendered once across the app containing the same four nav items (same order) and copyright text in the format: "© <current year> Yarson".
- **FR-005**: For this release, clicking "Work", "About", or "Contact" does not navigate away from the homepage (no route change). Clicking "Home" scrolls the viewport to the top.
- **FR-006**: Use semantic landmarks for structure: header, nav, main, footer elements present in the DOM.
- **FR-007**: The layout is responsive: at viewport widths from 320px to 1440px, header and footer nav items remain visible/readable without overlapping or being clipped.
- **FR-008**: No additional pages or routes are created beyond the homepage for this feature.
- **FR-009**: Header and footer are rendered once per page (no duplicate instances).

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Navigation Link**: label (Home/Work/About/Contact), action (placeholder | scroll-to-top), location (header/footer), order index.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: On a typical broadband connection, users see the header and main placeholder sentence within 1 second of page load.
- **SC-002**: At viewports between 320px and 1440px, 100% of nav labels are readable without overlap or clipping.
- **SC-003**: Keyboard-only users can traverse all header and footer nav items in logical order via Tab/Shift+Tab.
- **SC-004**: The footer displays the correct current year automatically in the copyright text for at least 99% of sessions over the year.
