# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

The plan MUST explicitly satisfy these gates:

- TDD: Document unit, integration, and E2E tests to be written first; define
  how failure is observed before implementation.
- Next.js 16 Approach: Server Components by default; list any Client Components
  with rationale; define cache/revalidation per route.
- Accessibility: State WCAG 2.2 AA acceptance criteria for primary journeys;
  include automated a11y checks in CI and manual keyboard testing plan.
- Performance: Commit to CWV targets (p75 LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS ≤ 0.1)
  and describe measurement strategy (e.g., Lighthouse/Playwright traces).
- Type Safety: TypeScript strict mode; typed public APIs; server-side input
  validation.
- Observability: Identify key actions and the logs/metrics to emit.
- UX: Confirm responsive layouts, consistent tokens, and clear copy for empty
  states/errors.
 - Security: Define security controls for the feature: input validation,
  authN/Z boundaries, CSRF strategy for mutations, security headers (CSP/HSTS),
  secrets management, dependency scanning, and abuse/rate limiting where needed.

## Complexity Tracking

> **Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified**

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
